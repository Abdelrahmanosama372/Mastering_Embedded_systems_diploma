# Temperature Sensor Reading and Display Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to read temperature data from an analog temperature sensor using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and display the temperature value on an LCD screen in Proteus simulation software.

## Project Components
- **Microcontroller**: ATmega32 microcontroller is used to interface with the temperature sensor and the LCD display in the Proteus simulation.
- **Temperature Sensor**: An analog LM35 temperature sensor is connected to one of the microcontroller's analog input pins. It provides analog voltage output corresponding to the temperature.
